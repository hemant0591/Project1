Basic data analysis

Using Kaggle’s “House Prices: Advance Regression Techniques” data I’m trying to predict the price of a property based on some 80 different data points. In this post I would explain how I approached this problem.

In this article we will try to answer following questions
1. Which are the most expensive neighborhoods?
2. Which data points correlate strongly to the sale price?
How to deal with skewed data?

Please check out the code in the jupyter notebook in the repository for more details
